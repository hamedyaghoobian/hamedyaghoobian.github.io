## Interactive AI Tools

This section showcases interactive tools and applications I've developed, exploring fun ways to engage with textual content using LLMs.

### Bot Without Organs

**[Visit Tool](https://botwithoutorgans.github.io/)**

An experimental conversational AI interface that enables interactive dialogue with Gilles Deleuze's famous A-Z interviews. This tool leverages LLMs on Groq to facilitate engaging conversations with English translations of Deleuze's expansive philosophical discussions originally conducted in French.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive chat interface with Deleuze's philosophical concepts
- Access to the complete A-Z interview series covering topics from "A for Animal" to "Z for Zigzag"
- LLM-powered responses based on Deleuze's actual interviews with Claire Parnet
- A built-in Deleuze-dictionary (right-click on a word to see the definition)

**Source Material:** Based on the comprehensive [Deleuze A-Z documentary](https://archive.org/details/2nz_20200124) - a remarkable "tour de force" covering Russian literature, film philosophy, and deep insights into Deleuze's life and philosophical framework.
