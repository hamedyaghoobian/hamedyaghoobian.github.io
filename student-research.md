## Research Focus

My research explores the intersections of artificial intelligence and human experience, with particular attention to the mutual shaping of technology, society, and culture.

This work engages three key areas:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Investigating computational models for understanding and generating human language, including large language models, text analysis, and human-AI communication.

* **Human-AI Interaction**: Studying how people engage with AI systems, with emphasis on evaluation, interpretability, and user experience design.

* **Critical AI Studies**: Examining the broader implications of AI technologies through interdisciplinary methods that combine technical inquiry with insights from ethics, philosophy, and the social sciences.

## Student Involvement

Muhlenberg students interested in these topics are welcome to reach out. While programming skills (especially in Python) are useful, I value:

* Curiosity about the societal roles of AI
* Interest in interdisciplinary approaches
* Willingness to engage with both technical and theoretical perspectives

Students can get involved through independent studies during the academic year or through summer research opportunities. If you'd like to discuss a possible project or collaboration, please don't hesitate to contact me.
