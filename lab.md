## Research Focus

The **MIND** (**M**uhlenberg **I**ntelligence and **N**eural **D**evelopment) Lab is a student research group investigating the interactions between artificial intelligence and human experience. Our work examines the bidirectional influences between technology, society, and culture.

Our research encompasses three key areas:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Exploring computational approaches to human language understanding and generation, including work on large language models, text analysis, and human-AI communication patterns.

- **Human-AI Interaction**: Developing and studying frameworks for AI system evaluation, interpretability, and user experience, with focus on making AI systems more transparent and accessible.

- **Critical AI Studies**: Investigating the broader implications of AI technologies through interdisciplinary lenses, combining technical analysis with perspectives from ethics, philosophy, and social sciences.

## Join Our Lab

We welcome Muhlenberg College students interested in exploring the intersection of AI technology and human experience. While programming skills (especially Python) and quantitative abilities are valuable, we particularly value:

- Curiosity about AI's role in society
- Interest in interdisciplinary approaches
- Willingness to engage with both technical and theoretical aspects of AI

Computer Science majors are especially encouraged to apply, but we consider students from all backgrounds who demonstrate strong interest in our research areas. The lab provides opportunities for independent research projects, collaborative studies, and meaningful contributions to the field of AI development and analysis.

For inquiries about joining the lab or aligning your research interests with our work, please contact us. We strive to create an inclusive environment where students can critically engage with AI technology while developing valuable research skills.
